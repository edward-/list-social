# Public Todo List - Social Network

This project is a small social network built upon the TODO example provided by Amplify as a demo application. The project includes significant enhancements to understand better the GEN 2 of Amplify and its integration with AWS services. It offers a deeper understanding of models and their interaction with GraphQL, showcasing practical use cases and advanced features of Amplify. 

Developed with Next.JS (App Router) and AWS Amplify.
